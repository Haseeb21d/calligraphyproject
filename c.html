        <p>Greek calligraphy, also known as Greek handwriting or Greek script, refers to the art of writing Greek
            letters in a visually appealing and expressive manner. It is a traditional form of writing that has been
            practiced for centuries in Greece and other Greek-speaking regions.

            Greek calligraphy encompasses various styles and techniques, each with its own unique characteristics.</p>
        <h3>Origins to the 8th century CE</h3>
        <p>The oldest Greek writing, syllabic signs scratched with a stylus on sun-dried clay, is that of the Linear B
            tablets found in Knossos, Pylos, and Mycenae (1400–1200 BCE). Alphabetic writing, in use before the end of
            the 8th century BCE, is first found in a scratched inscription on a jug awarded as a prize in Athens. The
            consensus is that the Homeric poems were written down not later than this time; certainly from the time of
            the first known lyric poet of ancient Greece, Archilochus (7th century BCE), individuals committed their
            works to writing. But the vehicles of literary writing have perished. Scratchings on pottery or metal and
            then texts deliberately cut in bronze or marble or painted on vases are, until about 350 BCE, the only
            immediate evidence for the way the Greeks wrote, and their study is normally treated as the province of
            epigraphy.</p>
        <p>A find in 1962 at Dervéni (Dhervénion), in Macedonia, of a carbonized roll of papyrus (Archaeological Museum,
            Thessaloníki, Greece) offers the oldest example of Greek handwriting and the only one preserved in the Greek
            peninsula (end of the 4th century BCE). From then until the 4th century CE, there are countless texts,
            especially on papyrus. Found in Egypt and, with a few exceptions, written there, these texts have given a
            firm foundation for knowledge about the handwriting of the era. From outside Egypt there is a Greek library
            buried in Herculaneum, 79 CE; and papyri and parchments from Owrāmān, Kurdistan, 1st century BCE; from
            Dura-Europus on the Euphrates, 3rd century BCE to 3rd century CE; from Nessana, 6th century CE; and from the
            Dead Sea area (Qumrān, 1st centuries BCE and CE; Murabbaʿat and ʿEn Gedi, 2nd century CE). A number of
            original vellum manuscripts have survived from the 4th century CE onward, preserved in libraries such as at
            the monastery of Saint Catherine at Mount Sinai. These materials of diverse origin suggest that the forms
            and shape of Greek handwriting were remarkably constant throughout the Greek world, wherever writing was
            practiced and whatever material was used; within this consistent framework it is occasionally possible to
            distinguish local variations (as between the contract hands of 1st-century-CE Dura and of Egypt).</p>
        <p>The principal vehicles for writing were wax tablets incised with a stylus or a prepared surface of skin, such
            as leather and vellum, or of papyrus written on with a pen. Other surfaces—e.g., broken pieces of pottery,
            lead, wood, and even cloth—were also used. To some extent the forms of letters were affected by the
            resistance of the material to the writing instrument. It is likely that the use as a pen of a hard reed,
            split at the tip and cut into a nib (which had to be constantly sharpened), is an invention of the Greeks.
            Egyptian scribes used a soft reed, with which ink was brushed on.</p>
        <p>Until about 300 CE, ink was usually made of a fine carbon powder such as lampblack, mixed with gum arabic and
            water, which even today retains its black lustre. Carbon inks were then replaced by iron-gall inks made from
            a mixture of tannic acid (made from oak galls soaked in water), ferrous sulphate, and gum arabic. There seem
            to have been several reasons for the changeover to iron-gall inks: they were easier and more economical to
            make, they could be made in quantity, and they did not flake off the surface of vellum (which was becoming
            the preferred writing surface of the time) as carbon inks did. Iron-gall ink does have certain drawbacks: it
            has a tendency to fade and oxidize over time, turning from a dark grayish-black when freshly written to a
            characteristic brown (which today is often associated with early manuscripts), and it sometimes has a
            corrosive effect on vellum, causing the writing from one side of a page to bleed through to the other. On
            paper, some iron-gall inks have actually eaten through the writing surface. Erasures, which could be made on
            wax with the blunt end of a stylus and on papyrus by wiping with a wet sponge, were more difficult on vellum
            written with iron-gall inks. Corrections were made by scraping the faulty text off with the edge of a knife,
            rubbing the surface with an abrasive, and then burnishing it to make it smooth enough to receive ink again.
            Sometimes when vellum was not easily available or was relatively expensive, an outdated text might be erased
            and written over. Since the ink actually dyes the vellum, traces of the original text often remain and
            appear faintly under newly written text. Such doubly written manuscripts are called palimpsests.</p>
        <p>Papyrus was normally sold in rolls (volumina) made up of 20 to 50 or more sheets. These sheets were made by
            laying freshly cut strips from the papyrus plant (Cyperus papyrus or Papyrus antiquorum) side by side in one
            direction with another layer of strips crossing them at right angles. Sometimes a third layer was added
            parallel to the first. This “sandwich” was then moistened with water and pressed together until dry, forming
            a sheet. The layer containing the horizontal fibres was placed on the inside of the roll, on which side (the
            recto) each attached sheet overlapped the next when the roll was held horizontally. Leather, similarly, was
            used for making rolls (e.g., the Dead Sea Scrolls). With the advent of the Christian Era, the custom of
            folding sheets of papyrus or vellum down the middle and stitching the gatherings of two or four sheets along
            this fold into a cover gave rise to a book of modern form—the codex (a word that originally referred to a
            set of wax tablets coupled with a leather thong).</p>
        <p>The early Christians deliberately chose the commercial vellum notebook (membranae) in which to circulate the
            Christian Gospels in preference to the traditional Jewish roll. Almost without exception the earliest texts
            of the New Testament are in codex form, even though written on papyrus, which is less able than vellum to
            bear repeated bending. In the 2nd century CE, pagan works of literature also appeared in this format. By the
            4th century it became the predominant form, and codices with handsome margins, of dazzling white vellum, and
            of sufficient size to contain the whole Bible (e.g., the Codex Sinaiticus) were being produced.</p>
        <p>The fundamental distinction in types of handwriting is that between book hands and documentary hands. The
            former, used especially for the copying of literature, aimed at clarity, regularity, and impersonality and
            often made an effect of beauty by their deliberate stylization. Usually they were the work of professionals.
            Outstanding calligraphy is not common among papyrus finds, perhaps because they are mainly provincial work.
            But the British Museum Bacchylides (discussed further under “The Roman period,” see below) or the Bodleian
            Library Homer can stand comparison with any later vellum manuscript from outside Egypt. Book texts are
            written in separately made capitals (often called uncials, but in Greek paleography, except for the
            time-hallowed class of biblical uncials, the term is better avoided) in columns of writing, with ample
            spaces between columns and good margins at head and foot. Punctuation (usually by high dot, a point next to
            the top of the last letter of a section) is minimal or completely absent; accents are inserted only in
            difficult poetic texts or as practice by children; and letters are not grouped into separate words.</p>
        <p>Documentary hands show a considerable range: stylized official “chancery” hands, the workaday writing of
            government clerks or of the street scribes who drew up wills or wrote letters to order, the idiosyncratic or
            nearly illiterate writing of private individuals. The scribe’s aim was to write quickly, lifting the pen
            very little and consequently often combining several letters in a continuous stroke (a ligature); from the
            running action of the pen, this writing is often termed cursive. Scribes also made frequent use of
            abbreviations. When the scribe was skillful in reconciling clarity and speed, such writing may have much
            character, even beauty; but it often degenerates into a formless, sometimes indecipherable, scrawl.</p>
        <p>Both types of hand, in spite of the different styles they assume at different periods, show remarkable
            uniformity and continuity in the shapes of letters. Behind both lies an unvarying basic alphabetic form
            taught in the schools. The more skillful a book-hand scribe was, the harder it is to date the scribe’s work.
            Documents in the ancient world carried a precise date; books never did. To assign dates to the latter,
            paleographers take account of their content, the archaeological context of their discovery, and technical
            points of book construction (e.g., quires, rulings) or modes of abbreviation. But they find of great
            service: (1) a stylistic comparison with those dated documentary hands that show resemblances to book hands,
            and (2) those cases where a roll was reused—i.e., has a literary text on its recto and a dated document on
            its verso (in which case there is an estimate for the literary text, generally no more than 50 years before
            the date of the verso) or has a dated document on the recto and a book hand on the verso (which gives a
            possible date for the literary text of not more than 25 years after the document). The number of illustrated
            manuscripts of this period is small; their quality is varied; and there is no agreement among specialists
            about the sources from which illustrations were taken.</p>
        <p>Any historical sketch is bound to be a simplification. At certain epochs several different styles of
            handwriting existed simultaneously, so that there is no straight line of development. Moreover, owing to the
            arbitrariness of finds, generalizations are based mainly on provincial work; and, even in that, examples of
            book hand belonging to the 2nd century BCE and the 5th century CE are still relatively rare.</p>
        <h4>Ptolemaic period</h4>
        <p>In the roll from Dervéni, Macedonia, dated on archaeological grounds to the 4th century BCE, lines and
            letters are well spaced and the letters carefully made in an epigraphic, or inscription, style, especially
            the square E, four-barred Σ, and arched Ω; the whole layout gives the effect of an inscription. In the
            Timotheus roll in Berlin (dated 350–330 BCE) or in the curse of Artemisia in Vienna (4th century BCE), the
            writing is cruder, and ω is in transition to what is afterward its invariable written form. Similar features
            can be seen in the earliest precisely dated document, a marriage contract of 311 BCE. It has been argued
            that a documentary hand of cursive type had not yet been developed and that it was a creation of the
            Alexandrian library. Plato, however (Laws 810), speaks of Athenian writing whose aim was speed; later on,
            when a cursive hand had certainly been developed, documentary scribes often used separate capitals.</p>
        <p>Characteristic of its period is the contrast of size between the long letters (e.g., calligraphy: Greek
            handwriting) and narrow letters . calligraphy: Greek handwritingAnd characteristic forms are to be seen in
            the letters calligraphy: Greek handwriting (with its long crossbar, often with initial stroke); calligraphy:
            Greek handwriting (upsilon) with long shallow bowl; calligraphy: Greek handwriting or calligraphy: Greek
            handwriting in three or four strokes; calligraphy: Greek handwriting in three strokes; calligraphy: Greek
            handwriting (alpha) raised off the line and its last vertical not finished; small round calligraphy: Greek
            handwriting (with internal dot or tiny stroke); and broad epigraphic calligraphy: Greek handwriting and
            calligraphy: Greek handwriting. In documentary cursive hands of this period, letters seem to hang from an
            upper line: calligraphy: Greek handwriting (alpha) often turns into a mere wedge, and calligraphy: Greek
            handwriting (nu) lifts its second vertical above the line.</p>
        <p>In the 2nd century BCE the contrast between long letters and narrow letters disappears, the writing grows
            rounder, and letters are often linked by ligatures at the top of their last vertical (e.g., calligraphy:
            Greek handwriting). In a loan contract of 99 BCE (The John Rylands University Library of Manchester), in
            which capitals and cursive are mixed, this irregular roundness is clearly seen. Note the ε with detached
            crossbar and the exaggerated serifs which have been elevated by some paleographers into a criterion of a
            special style, though in fact they are always apt to occur.</p>
        <h4>Roman period</h4>
        <p>Half a century or so passed after 30 BCE before a definitely Roman manner was established. In documentary
            hands the tendency to roundness continued. Documentary cursive may be influenced in various ways (e.g., by
            Latin forms such as those of e and d, or by the exaggeration of verticals practiced by chancery scribes);
            the script may lean over in either direction, or it may be reduced to tiny proportions. In the 2nd century
            the cursive hand tended to be round and sprawling, in the 3rd century to become more angular, and in the 4th
            century to become characterless and to combine letters into ligatures that distorted the forms of the
            letters concerned. The book hand of a manuscript of Plato’s Phaedo (c. 100 CE; Egypt Exploration Society,
            London) shares the informality of cursive but regularizes the letter forms. Written on a larger scale and
            with more formality, this round hand can be very beautiful. In an example found at Hawara (2nd century CE),
            almost every letter (even ρ, τ, ι) would go into an identical square; only ϕ and ψ cross it above and below,
            μ, ω, and π horizontally.</p>
        <p>If this writing is made to lean to the right and to revive the 3rd-century-BCE distinction between narrow and
            broad letters, it takes on the aspect of the “severe” style of the Bacchylides roll in the British Museum
            (2nd century CE). If, however, the scribe makes the verticals or obliques thicker and his horizontals
            thinner, the hand is called biblical uncial, so named because this type is used in the three great early
            vellum codices of the Bible: Codex Vaticanus and Codex Sinaiticus of the 4th century and Codex Alexandrinus
            of the 5th century. It is now certain that this style goes back to the 2nd century CE. Heavy decoration is
            also a feature of the Coptic style, of which there are examples as early as the 2nd century CE. This hand
            may be thought of as constituting a special case of biblical uncial.</p>
        <h4>Byzantine period</h4>
        <p>For the paleographer the significant division is not the founding of Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey) in
            330 but the 5th century, from which a few firmly dated texts survive. At its close a large, exuberant,
            florid cursive was fully established for documents; in the 7th and 8th centuries it sloped to the right,
            became congested, and adopted some forms that anticipated the minuscule hand. A favourite informal type of
            the 6th century is shown in an acrostic poem by Dioscorus of Aphrodito; it bears a clear relationship to the
            Menander Dyskolos hand, which was probably written in the later 3rd century CE. Similar pairs could be found
            to illustrate the continuity in transformation of the biblical uncial and Coptic styles. The latest Greek
            papyrus from Egypt is not later than the 8th century. There was a considerable lapse of time before the
            history of Greek writing resumed at Byzantium.</p>
        <h4>The 8th to 16th century</h4>
        <p>To judge when and where a Greek manuscript was written is as difficult for this as for the earlier period,
            but for different reasons. The material for study is admittedly more extensive; manuscripts produced in the
            Middle Ages and Renaissance have been preserved in very large numbers (more than 50,000 whole volumes
            survive, of which probably 4,000 or 5,000 are explicitly dated), and they include work from most parts of
            the Byzantine Empire as well as from Italy. The difficulty of the paleographer lies in the essential
            homogeneity of the material, which is largely the result of the conditions in which the manuscripts were
            produced.</p>
        <p>The fully developed Byzantine Empire of the 8th to the mid-15th centuries was extraordinarily uniform in its
            culture. Its contraction in space after the Arab conquests of the 7th century, which cut off the more
            distant and ethnically differentiated provinces of Syria, Palestine, and Egypt, made it a relatively compact
            geographical entity. The continuity and comparative stability of a single empire not divided into distinct
            national states such as evolved in the West resulted in a strength and unity of tradition of which the
            Byzantines were always conscious and that shows in their habits of writing no less than in their literature
            and art. Distinct local styles and sharp breaks in ways of writing in different periods cannot, therefore,
            be looked for; characteristics that may be especially typical of one period emerge gradually and disappear
            equally slowly. A more potent factor than date or place in producing divergences in the style of writing is
            the purpose for which a manuscript was designed and what type of scribe wrote it.</p>
        <h4>Late uncial, 9th to 12th century</h4>
        <p>There is a gap in the evidence covering the 7th and 8th centuries, because of the Arab conquest of Egypt, the
            perpetual wars on all fronts in the 7th century, and the iconoclastic struggle among Eastern Christians
            during the 8th and early 9th centuries, so that no literary texts (and very few others) have survived that
            can actually be dated to this period.</p>
        <p>During this time the evolution of writing in capitals (a style called uncial) probably continued toward a
            greater formality and artificiality. But this natural tendency was hastened by the introduction and spread
            of minuscule as the normal way of writing, after which the purpose of uncial changed completely. From an
            everyday hand in which all books were naturally written, it became a ceremonial hand used only for special
            copies and therefore grew increasingly stylized and artificial. In the 9th century a still elegant style was
            used for both patristic and classical works in splendid volumes destined for the imperial library or for
            presentation copies, such as the copy of Gregory of Nazianzus (Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris) made for the
            emperor Basil I between 879 and 883. By the 11th and 12th centuries, capitals were used only for liturgical
            books, mainly lectionaries, which had to be read in dimly lit churches; but the increasing tortuousness of
            the style must in the end have reduced its usefulness, and by about 1200 uncial was dead.</p>
        <h4>Earliest minuscule, 8th to 10th century</h4>
        <p>By far the most important development that took place during the 7th–8th-century gap was the introduction of
            minuscule. There is no incontrovertible evidence of how this came about, or where. What scraps of evidence
            there are (a few documents from the gap, a few sentences in lives of the abbots of Stoudion of that time,
            and the first dated manuscript written in true minuscule) point to its development from a certain type of
            documentary hand used in the 8th century and to the likelihood that the monastery of the Stoudion in
            Constantinople had a leading part in its early development. Though its origins are obscure, the reasons that
            led to its introduction and rapid spread are obvious: the state of poverty resulting from wars and
            persecutions coincided with a shortage of papyrus after the Arab conquest of Egypt in the middle of the 7th
            century, and these factors combined to induce a search for a more economical use of the relatively expensive
            vellum; the polemics of the iconoclastic controversy demanded a speedy, informal style of writing; and,
            finally, when peace was restored in the middle of the 9th century, the revival of learning, with the
            reorganization of the university, brought the need for multiplying plain workmanlike texts for scholarly
            purposes.</p>
        <p>The earliest dated example of true minuscule (and it is probably one of the oldest extant examples
            altogether) is a Gospel written in 835 (Porfiry Gospel; National Library of Russia, St. Petersburg),
            probably in the monastery of the Stoudion. Here are found all the characteristics of the earliest minuscule,
            which is called pure minuscule because there is as yet no admixture of uncial forms, except occasionally at
            line ends. The letters are even and of a uniform size; letters are joined or not joined to each other
            according to strict rules, sometimes by ligatures in which part of each letter is merged in the other, but
            not to the extent of distorting the shape of either letter. There is no division between words, for the
            divisions are only those that arise from the rules for joining or otherwise of individual letters, and at
            this stage any letter that can be joined to the next one nearly always is joined to it. Breathings, which
            affect pronunciation, are square, either calligraphy: Greek handwriting or calligraphy: Greek handwriting,
            and accents are small and neat; abbreviations are very few, usually confined to the established contractions
            for nomina sacra (the names and descriptions of the Trinity and certain derivatives), omitted ν at line
            ends, a few of the conventional signs for omitted case endings, and sometimes a ligature for και (“and”).
            The writing stands on the ruled lines or is guided by them.</p>
        <p>Absolutely pure minuscule did not last long. Gradually, uncial forms of those letters that had specifically
            minuscule forms began to be used alongside the minuscule forms: λ was the first to appear, followed by ξ and
            then κ, all by the end of the 9th century. Then from about 900 onward, γ, ζ, ν, π, and σ were used
            regularly, while α, δ, ε, and η were used sometimes. Not before about 950 were β, μ, υ, ψ, and ω used, and
            still comparatively rarely. But by the end of the 10th century, the interchangeability of all uncial and
            minuscule forms was complete, though all the alternative forms are not necessarily found in any one
            manuscript. Perhaps the earliest dated manuscript with any uncial form in it is of 892/893 (Mount Sinai,
            Saint Catherine, MS. 375 + St. Petersburg, Bibl. Publ. MS. 343, Chrysostom), but pure minuscule continued to
            be used, in probably the majority of manuscripts, up to 900 and thereafter mainly in provincial manuscripts
            until the last dated example in 969 (Metéora, Metamorph. MS. 565, John Climacus). Besides the intrusion of
            uncial letters, some other characteristics of the earliest minuscule were modified during the 10th century.
            Rounded breathings, symbolized by the marks ‘ and ’, are first found in manuscripts of the last half of the
            century, interspersed with square ones. From about 925 the practice of making the writing hang from the
            ruled lines began to prevail. Although in most manuscripts abbreviations were confined to a few forms used
            at line ends only, a few copies dated in the last part of the century used nearly all the conventional
            signs.</p>
        <p></p>

        In spite of these developments—the gradual disappearance of pure minuscule and the other changes that
        accompanied it—the same general styles of writing persisted until about the end of the 10th century. Broadly
        considered, three styles can be distinguished during this period. There is a rather primitive-looking, angular,
        cramped style that may perhaps be associated with the Stoudion monastery, in which a certain number of mainly
        patristic texts were written c. 880–c. 980. Second, there is a plain, neat, workmanlike style (seen in a
        commentary on Gregory of Nazianzus copied in 986 that is preserved in the Bibliothèque Nationale at Paris),
        which continued in use at least until the end of the 10th century. In it were written several of the important
        manuscripts that are now the oldest texts of some ancient Greek authors (for example, Aeschylus, Sophocles, and
        Aristophanes) but are unfortunately not explicitly dated. Third, a consciously elegant, even mannered, style was
        used in books produced for the imperial library or for wealthy dignitaries, but it is not found before the early
        years of the 10th century. All of these styles, which have numerous variations and are by no means always
        distinct from one another, are found at least until the end of the 10th century. Their one common characteristic
        is a crispness and individuality that clearly distinguishes them from writing of the next period.
        <h4>Formal minuscule, 10th to 14th century</h4>
        <p>From about the middle of the 10th century, a smoother, almost mechanical appearance can be noticed in an
            increasing number of manuscripts; the hands seem more stereotyped, less individual. They are not immediately
            distinguishable from the plainer styles of the earlier part of the century, and their evolution during the
            next four centuries was very gradual. A few distinct types can be singled out from time to time. A bold,
            round, heavy liturgical style, fully established in the 11th century, was one of the most enduring types; it
            became more and more stereotyped and mechanical until, in the 15th century, a branch of it was transplanted
            to Italy.</p>
        <p>The style most widely used for biblical and patristic texts from the end of the 10th century, probably mainly
            in monastic houses in Constantinople, was one with plain, neat, rounded letters; this style became known as
            Perlschrift from its likeness to small, round beads strung together. A very plain, businesslike, rather
            staccato style was used in manuscripts with musical notation, most commonly in the 12th and 13th centuries.
        </p>
        <p>Manuscripts written outside Constantinople are recognizable, if at all, usually by a rougher, provincial
            appearance. Only two styles can be assigned with any certainty to a specific provincial centre. One, a small
            unpretentious hand used by Saint Nilus of Rossano, the founder of numerous monasteries in southern Italy at
            the end of the 9th century, was used for a time by others in that area. In the heyday of the reorganized
            Greek monasteries there in the 12th century, another elegant, rather mannered style, which almost certainly
            had its origin in Constantinople, is nevertheless found in manuscripts known to have been written in
            southern Italy and Sicily.</p>
        <p>These particular styles, however, are not really as typical of the period as the less distinctive plain hands
            in which the majority of the manuscripts are written, at least in the 11th and 12th centuries.</p>
        <p>The comparatively uniform type of writing of which all these were minor variations was remarkably enduring
            and widely dispersed, but, from the 11th century onward, certain changes may be observed that help to date
            manuscripts written in all types of formal minuscule. One change in its general appearance may be noticed as
            the 12th century advanced: an increasing lightness of touch and a lessening of the closely knit, rather
            thick appearance that is characteristic of the 11th century. But the most noticeable change in this period
            is the breakdown in the evenness and regularity of the writing, which is partly attributable to the
            influence of documentary and the later personal hands. It is not, however, entirely so attributable, for a
            tendency to enlarge some letters out of proportion to the size of the rest is seen in a small way in some of
            the more personal hands of the earliest period. But it is rare in formally written manuscripts, only
            gradually becoming more general until, in the 12th and 13th centuries, it is the most noticeable feature of
            even the most formal hands. In the 14th century and later there was a return to less flamboyant ways with
            the tendency to imitate earlier models more closely, but the habit of enlarging some and diminishing the
            size of other letters never died out.</p>
        <p>In the actual forms of letters used in these formal styles, there was practically no change; very
            occasionally, from the end of the 10th century onward, one of the “modern” forms of letter normally confined
            to personal hands found its way into a formal manuscript. Much the same is true of ligatures. The tendency
            from the 11th century onward was to use ligatures and to join letters less automatically than in earlier
            times. The permissive rules and most of the forms remained unchanged, for, already in the 10th century, most
            of the distorting forms (notably those in which the ε is represented only by a C-shaped stroke; e.g.,
            calligraphy: Greek handwriting for σε) were well established, and in formal manuscripts these, with the
            earlier forms, continued in use until they were illogically taken over by the first printers of Greek. Time
            did, however, gradually increase the tendency to join letters by insetting them in or superimposing them
            upon each other. Abbreviations were even more conservatively used, only the oldest conventional forms being
            admitted, and often only a very few and those only at line ends.</p>
        <p>The rule that the writing should hang from the ruled lines, already applied in most manuscripts by the
            mid-10th century, became invariable by the middle of the 11th. Square breathings (used indiscriminately
            among the round ones) were gradually eliminated, though they did not completely disappear from formal
            manuscripts until the middle of the 12th century. The practice of joining accents with breathings and also
            with the letters to which they belonged spread from personal hands to formal writing in the 13th century,
            but it was far more often avoided altogether.</p>
        <p>Apart from the actual writing, one development is common to all manuscripts written in this period: the use
            of paper instead of vellum, which occurred first perhaps in the late 11th century and was common by the 13th
            century whenever economy was a major consideration.</p>
        <p>These are the main criteria by which a formally written manuscript can be assigned to an earlier or a later
            part of this period. But the problem of distinguishing different styles and their dates, and their places of
            origin, remains most difficult for these Greek manuscripts.</p>
        <h4>Personal hands, 12th to 14th century</h4>
        <p>From the beginning of minuscule, there were obviously educated individuals who occasionally copied texts for
            their own use in a formal hand that nevertheless had a distinctive personal flavour; indeed, professional
            scribes occasionally used a less formal style than usual. Several dated examples of this type of hand
            survive from the 10th, 11th, and early 12th centuries, but they are rarities. Toward the end of the 12th
            century, however, the prosperity and comparative stability of the Comnenan age (named from the dynasty of
            Byzantine emperors bearing the name Comnenus), with its brilliant literary and artistic achievements, gave
            way to increasing internal chaos and the hostile encirclement of Byzantium that was a prelude to the Fourth
            Crusade and the sack of Constantinople by the Western powers in 1204. Scholars perhaps already felt the
            pinch of poverty, which naturally grew greater during the exile of the Byzantine court (1204–61) and
            culminated in the economic crises of the 14th century.</p>
        <p>Certainly, a change in writing habits began slowly to take place. Instead of commissioning professional
            scribes to copy manuscripts, some scholars began to make copies for themselves, and, in place of the smooth,
            mechanical styles of the professionals, they used the sort of writing that they presumably already used for
            personal notes. This was an adaptation (for greater clarity) of the type of writing that had been
            standardized in official documents from the beginning of the Byzantine period. Its chief characteristic was
            the greatly exaggerated size of certain letters or parts of letters, particularly letters with rounded bows
            such as β, ε, ζ, θ, κ, ξ, ο, υ, ϕ, and ω, and the excessive size of these letters is made to look even more
            unbalanced by some exceptionally small forms of, for example, η, ι, ν, or ρ. This essentially unbalanced,
            “wild” look was transplanted to literary manuscripts written by scholars for their own use.</p>
        <p>Along with this exaggerated contrast in size between letters, they took from the documentary hands several
            new forms of letters that had gradually evolved from the originally common forms of both hands. In the 12th
            century the new scholarly hands began to use calligraphy: Greek handwriting with separate small bows;
            calligraphy: Greek handwriting, with a broken back; calligraphy: Greek handwriting, which had lost its high
            first stroke; and calligraphy: Greek handwriting, which had dropped its first long downstroke; and, by the
            end of the 13th century, calligraphy: Greek handwriting, with a short embryonic tail. The old forms of
            ligature were kept basically the same but in some cases were reduced to a barely recognizable minimum (e.g.,
            calligraphy: Greek handwriting or calligraphy: Greek handwriting for ει) and in others were distorted by the
            general flourishing tendency of the script (e.g., calligraphy: Greek handwriting for επ). Abbreviations were
            naturally used with great frequency in all positions; the ancient conventional signs for suppressed
            syllables, which had acquired rounded and more flourished shapes, were used alongside a certain amount of
            “arbitrary” abbreviation in which a large part of a word was omitted and replaced simply by a general sign
            that some abbreviation had taken place.</p>
        <p>Accents and breathings joined with each other, with letters, and with abbreviation marks are found earlier
            and more frequently in scholarly than in formal manuscripts. The only exception to the rule of round
            breathings in this type of manuscript is in cases of deliberate archaism such as practiced by Demetrius
            Triclinius.</p>
        <p>One of the earliest datable examples of these scholarly productions is the copy of his commentary on Homer’s
            Odyssey (Biblioteca Nazionale Marciana, Venice) written c. 1150–70 by Eustathius, the scholar-archbishop of
            Thessalonica. In the 13th century the exaggeration of especially round features reached its height, while in
            the 14th century the tendency, as in the formal styles of writing, was toward less ebullience and
            exaggeration, and the writing of scholars such as Triclinius is compact and sober. For these hands the
            problem is not to discover centres of writing or styles for different uses but to identify the hands of
            individual scholars.</p>
        <h4>The Italian Renaissance</h4>
        <p>By the end of the 14th century, Italian scholars were learning Greek, and they were bringing back Greek
            manuscripts from Constantinople. At this time Greek scholars had also begun to teach in Italy. The Greek
            that the earliest Italians learned to write was a clear, simple style taught originally by Manuel
            Chrysoloras (died 1415). But, although they copied a number of manuscripts for themselves in this hand, the
            style had no influence beyond their small circle.</p>
        <p>Before long, Greek scribes began to go to Italy, and both scholars and scribes arrived in increasing numbers
            as the Turks pressed in around the Byzantine capital until it finally fell in 1453. They brought with them,
            naturally, the two styles of writing that had persisted throughout the history of the empire. On the one
            hand, professional scribes such as Joannes Rhosus (died c. 1500), the majority of them from Crete, copied an
            astonishing number of manuscripts in the formal—and by this time glib and stereotyped—“liturgical” style of
            writing. On the other hand, scholars such as John (Janus) Lascaris continued to write in a mannered personal
            style (e.g., a letter of Demetrius Chalcondyles of 1488 in the Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana, Vatican
            City).</p>
        <p>It was on the scholarly hands that Aldus Manutius and other early Italian printers of Greek based their
            types. But perhaps the most enduring was that of a group of Cretan scribes who were employed by the French
            king Francis I in his library at Fontainebleau. The writing of one in particular, Angelus Vergecius, was
            used as a model for the French Royal Greek type, which has influenced the form of Greek printing down to the
            present day.</p><br><br>
