            <p>Arabic calligraphy is the artistic practice of handwriting and calligraphy based on the Arabic alphabet.
                It is
                known in Arabic as khatt (Arabic: خط), derived from the word 'line', 'design', or 'construction'.[1][2]
                Kufic is
                the oldest form of the Arabic script.

                From an artistic point of view, Arabic calligraphy has been known and appreciated for its diversity and
                great
                potential for development. In fact, it has been linked in the Arabic culture to various fields such as
                religion,
                art, architecture, education and craftsmanship, which in return have played an important role in its
                advancement.[3]

                Although most Islamic calligraphy is in Arabic and most Arabic calligraphy is Islamic, the two are not
                identical. Coptic or other Christian manuscripts in Arabic, for example, have made use of calligraphy.
                Likewise,
                there is Islamic calligraphy in Persian or the historic Ottoman language.</p>

            <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;"><b>Arabic Alphabet:</b></h2>
            <h3> Main article: Arabic alphabet</h3>
            <P>The Arabic alphabet is one of the most widely used scripts in the world. Many scholars believe that the
                alphabet
                was created around the 4th century CE.[4] The alphabet consists of 28 letters written from right to
                left. Each
                letter can be written in four ways, depending on where the letter is placed in a word. These four
                locations are
                also known as initial, medial, final and isolated.</P>

            <h3> Implements</h3>
            <p> The pens used for Arabic calligraphy vary from Latin calligraphy. The tools used for calligraphy are
                different
                assortments of pens and calligraphy ink. The most common calligraphy pen used is Qalam.[5]</p>

            <h3><b> Khamish pen</b></h3>
            <p>The Khamish pen also known as a reed pen is used by Arab, Turkish, and Iranian calligraphers. The reed of
                the
                pen is grown along rivers. Although this pen has been used for over 500 years, preparing the pen is a
                lengthy
                process.</p>

            <h3><b>Java pen</b></h3>
            <P>The Java pen is known for the tool's hardness and ability to create sharp edges. The pen is good to use
                for
                small scripts.</P>

            <h3><b>Handam pen</b></h3>
            <p>The Handam pen consists of the same strength that the Java pen has. The pen is good to use for all kinds
                of
                scripts.
            </p>
            <h3><b>Celi pen</b></h3>
            <p>The Celi pen is used for large writing in Arabic calligraphy. These pens are made from hardwood and cut
                and
                drilled.
            </p>
            <h2 style="text-decoration: none;">Scripts</h2>
            <h3>Popular scripts</h3>
            <p>The two most popular scripts used for Arabic calligraphy are Kufic and Naskh. Kūfic was derived from Iraq
                and
                initially used for inscription on stone and metal. Naskhī originated from Mecca and Medina. The script
                is used
                as a cursive script, for example on papyrus and paper.
            </p>
            <h3>Other scripts</h3>
            <p>The Thuluth and Nasta'liq and Diwani script are other scripts used for Arabic scripting.</p>

            <p>The Thuluth script used during the medieval times is known as one of the oldest scripts to exist. The
                script was
                used on mosques and for Quranic text due to the appearance of the text.</p>

            <p>The Nasta'liq script is used more for Persian than Arabic scripting. Because of the upward slant to the
                left,[6]
                the script is seen as different from the other scripts. The cursive look creates an elegant look when
                creating.
            </p>
            <p>The Diwani Script was created during the Ottoman era. The lining and lettering of this script creates a
                sense of
                closeness when writing. Due to this reason, it's difficult to read since the letters intertwine.[6]

                <h3>Typography</h3>
                <p> Arabic calligraphy serves as a major source of inspiration for Arabic typography. For example, the
                    Amiri
                    typeface is inspired by the Naskh script used at the Amiri Press in Cairo.[8]

                    The shift from Arabic calligraphy to Arabic typography presents technical challenges, as Arabic is
                    essentially a
                    cursive script with contextual shapes.</p>

                <h3> Art</h3>
                <p>EL Seed, a French-Tunisian graffiti artist, makes use of Arabic calligraphy in his various art
                    projects, in a
                    style called calligraffiti.[9]</p>

                <p>The Hurufiyya (الحروفية letters) movement, since its beginnings in the early 20th century, uses the
                    artistic
                    manipulation of Arabic calligraphy and typography in abstraction.[10]
                </p>
                <p>Taking Shape: Abstraction From the Arab World, 1950s-1980s, a 2020 installation at New York
                    University's Grey
                    Art Gallery, explored how Arabic calligraphy, with its ancient presence in visual art, influenced
                    abstract art
                    in the Arab world.[11] For Madiha Omar, the Arabic alphabet was a means of expressing a secular
                    identity and
                    appropriating Western painting, while Omar El-Nagdi explored the inherent divinity of Arabic
                    calligraphy.[11]
